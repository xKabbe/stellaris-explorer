## About Me

I am a dedicated developer with a passion for astronomy and data exploration.
The Stellaris Explorer project is a reflection of my enthusiasm for leveraging Python to delve into the mysteries of exoplanet catalog data.
From orbital parameters to planetary masses and sizes, I aim to provide a user-friendly interface for enthusiasts and researchers alike.
If you share an interest in space exploration or Python development, I welcome you to explore this project with me.
